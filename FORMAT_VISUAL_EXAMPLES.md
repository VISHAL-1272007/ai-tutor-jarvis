## 🏥 Example 4: No Live Sources (General Knowledge)

### Query
```
"Explain photosynthesis"
```

### JARVIS Response
```markdown
**Photosynthesis Explanation** - Status as of Jan 28, 2026

⚠️ **Note**: No live research sources were searched for this query. Information below is based on established scientific knowledge.

**Process Overview:**
- Photosynthesis is the biological process by which plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. This occurs primarily in chloroplasts containing the green pigment chlorophyll.

**Light-Dependent Reactions:**
- These reactions take place in thylakoid membranes and require direct light. Water molecules split (photolysis) releasing oxygen as a byproduct. Energy captured produces ATP and NADPH.

**Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle):**
- Occur in the stroma of chloroplasts and do not require direct light. Carbon dioxide fixation happens through the enzyme RuBisCO. The cycle produces glucose using ATP and NADPH from light reactions.

**Chemical Equation:**
- The overall equation: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂. This shows carbon dioxide and water converting to glucose and oxygen using light energy.

**Significance:**
- Photosynthesis is the primary source of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere. It forms the foundation of most food chains and captures approximately 130 terawatts of solar energy annually.
