**"Hello everyone!**

My name is Vishal, and I'm excited to introduce you to **JARVIS 6.0** - a revolutionary AI-powered student assistant that's changing the way students learn.

This isn't just a college project. JARVIS is a **real, production-ready platform** currently serving **over 30,000 students** worldwide, and today, I'll show you exactly why it's different from anything you've seen before.

### 🏠 HOME PAGE & AI CHAT (45 seconds)

**[Open homepage - show JARVIS orb]**

**"This is the heart of JARVIS - our AI chat interface.**

You'll notice this beautiful, animated orb - this represents JARVIS, your personal AI assistant. Now, what makes JARVIS truly powerful is that it doesn't rely on just one AI model.

**[Point to interface]**

We're using **FIVE different AI providers simultaneously** - Groq with 30 requests per minute, Gemini with 15, OpenRouter with 20, HuggingFace with 10, and AIMLAPI with 50 requests per minute. That's a **total capacity of 95 requests every single minute**, which means zero lag, even when thousands of students are using it at the same time.

**[Type a question like "Explain quantum computing"]**

Watch this - I'll ask JARVIS to explain quantum computing...

**[Wait for response]**

See how fast that was? Instant, detailed, and accurate. JARVIS can help with coding problems, math equations, science concepts, essay writing - literally anything a student needs.

**[Click microphone icon]**

But here's something even better - **voice control!**
