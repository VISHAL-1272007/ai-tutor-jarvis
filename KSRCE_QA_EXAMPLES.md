**Q8: How to solve Laplace transforms at KSRCE standard?**

Expected Answer:
"In K.S.R. College of Engineering's Engineering Mathematics III, Laplace transforms are taught systematically:

**Basic Definition:**
L{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫₀^∞ e^(-st) f(t) dt, where s > s₀

**Standard Transform Pairs (KSRCE Formula Book includes):**
- L{1} = 1/s
- L{e^(at)} = 1/(s-a)
- L{sin(at)} = a/(s² + a²)
- L{cos(at)} = s/(s² + a²)
- L{t^n} = n!/s^(n+1)

**Solution Method for Differential Equations:**

Given: dy/dt + 2y = e^(-t), y(0) = 1

Step 1: Take Laplace transform of both sides
L{dy/dt} + 2L{y} = L{e^(-t)}

Step 2: Apply derivative rule: L{dy/dt} = sY(s) - y(0)
sY(s) - 1 + 2Y(s) = 1/(s+1)

Step 3: Solve for Y(s)
Y(s)(s + 2) = 1/(s+1) + 1
Y(s) = [1 + (s+1)]/[(s+1)(s+2)]
Y(s) = (s+2)/[(s+1)(s+2)] = 1/(s+1)

Step 4: Take inverse Laplace
y(t) = L^(-1){1/(s+1)} = e^(-t)

**This problem format is standard in KSRCE EM-III exams.** Success depends on knowing standard transform pairs and being able to use partial fractions for inverse transforms."
